# 1. Goal "A calculator with German-words-recognition-function"
 The goal is a simple calculator. 
 
 For this purpose a web-UI has to be created, which can take expressions as user input.
 
 
 This expressions shall be evaluated on a web-server and the result has to be return as a web-site.
 
 
 Also remarkable about this calculator is that it recognizes German words as numbers and operators.
 
 
# 2. Process
The text has to be entered in a multi-line input-field. 
 
For every line there may be an expression. 
 
After confirmation through the user the text will be processed. The result is shown to the user in an appropriate form.
 
Example 
Input:
 
`dreihundertzweiundneunzig mal 7`

`zw√∂lf durch drei`


Result on the web-site:

`2744`

`4`

The program shall support the operators '+', '-', '*' and '/' in German words and literals, either shall the numbers from -9.999.999 to 9.999.999
be supported in German words and numbers.

# 3. Release
- all needed web-sites or compiled program
- commented source code
- a short description of how the program works
